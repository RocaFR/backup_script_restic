- to many different storage types, including self-hosted and online services
- easily, being a single executable that you can run without a server or complex setup
- effectively, only transferring the parts that actually changed in the files you back up
- securely, by careful use of cryptography in every part of the process
- verifiably, enabling you to make sure that your files can be restored when needed
- freely - restic is entirely free to use and completely open source
